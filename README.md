## Some projects I've created to test my beginner skills.

[FindWords](https://github.com/lazymazyjazzy/for_fun/blob/main/findwords.py)
: NYTimes Spelling Bee cheater with a word generator. Was taking too long to calculate and generate all words.

[NYTimes Spelling Bee Cheater](https://github.com/lazymazyjazzy/for_fun/blob/main/NYTimes%20Spelling%20Bee%20Game%20Cheater.py): Basic cheater with results in seconds. Optimized version for FindWords. Detailed explanation about the game; you can find it in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/n7ov1n/nytimes_spelling_bee_game_cheater/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

[Global Interest Calculator](https://github.com/lazymazyjazzy/for_fun/blob/main/Global%20Interest%20Calculator.py): Was an example project for web scraping. Gets data from web for the global interest rates of countries and calculates a money value 
                            within given dates.
