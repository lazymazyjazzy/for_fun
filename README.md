# for_fun
Some projects I've created for fun to test my skills.

FindWords: NYTimes Spelling Bee cheater with a word generator. Was taking too long to calculate and generate all words.

NYTimes Spelling Bee Cheater: Basic cheater with results in seconds. Optimized version of FindWords.

Global Interest Calculator: Was an example project for web scraping. Gets data from web for the global interest rates of countries and calculates a money value 
                            within given dates.
